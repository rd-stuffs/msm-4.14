# Quirks / Adaptations
## C-style
- GNU23, but written in a way compatible to GNU17/GNU11 compilers.
- pointer-heavy. assumes little endian on everything.
- metaprogramming is actually happening: compile-time overloading/reflection, RAII-like cleanup, template-like type trickery
- compat and backports are also done through that metaprogramming (mostly redefinitions)
- heavy use of compiler attributes / builtins, this is intended.
- minimum is GCC 4.9 / Clang 10

## build system
- unity build, single unit
- causes heavy inlining (high stack overflow risk)
- ensure inlining control (inline, noinline attributes)
- stack safety is disabled
- redefines str/mem fn's to builtins

## hooking
- wired up for aarch64 and armeabi, k3.0 ~ mainline (7.2 as of current)
- prefer syscalls and LSM always
- syscall table hooking is implemented
- ARM64 'branch-link', callsite inline hooking support for sucompat and 6.8+ LSM.
- real-deal-but-brittle kallsyms bruteforcer to hunt ksyms.
- manual hooking is still supported and will be kept forever.

## sucompat
- tweaked for downstream
- simd-like, last word first, per word compare
- sucompat gate is tweaked too

## LSM framework
- pure function pointer on sub 6.8
- 3.x LSM scans the whole kernel to hunt for selinux_ops.
- 4.2 ~ 6.8 relies on first list member hijack.
- 6.8+ LSM relies on branch link hooking. ARM64 only.
- manual hooking also available.

## task_fix_setuid LSM
- upstream was on this before
- for seccomp disabling and umount feature
#### we don't have seccomp filter caching
- we just disable seccomp on setuid LSM
- we also reuse this seccomp status as sucompat gate
- we do this regardless of kernel version

## pkg_observer is on inode_rename LSM
- upstream was on this before
- this is faster, we filter uid
- we dont watch a full folder for shit
#### throne_tracker
- first run is synchronous by default due to FDE/FBEv1 (some)
- kthreaded on successive runs
- lock contention/double locking and race conditions are handled

## security_file_permission LSM
- we use this to avoid hooking sys_read for manual hooks
- after all we just need file pointer
- however if theres syscall table hook or kprobes_ksud, we hook it on there instead
- we also use this for "second stage apply" instead of execve_ksud

## bprm LSM
- defferent hooks for different kernels
- think of this as "after sys_execve"
- lockless argv pullouts for sulog
- might be used for something later

## selinux_hide
- we have a thin implementation downstream
- no kallsyms reliance, we hunt file operations instead, we try to keep this if possible.

## safe mode
- the implementation accepts 3x VOLUME_UP or 3x VOLUNE_DOWN to trigger safemode
- we have a dedicated input handler for this
- this will be disabled once ksud runs on_post_fs_data / ksu_is_safe_mode
- if theres no ksud to call it, it will disable itself 30s after init.rc load
- this should be enough allowance time from init.rc to post-fs-data

## kthreads
- theres a lot of these on the codebase even for mundane tasks

## log / reminders
- some kernels reads 'cold + noinline' as __init, which evicts our fn. avoid this combination.
- some kernels have autistic inlining which also fucks up if we ever wanted to \__attribute\_\_((flatten)) (e.g. sultan and other 'optimization')
- static_assert on fn ptr (e.g. static_assert(!!&kernel_read);) on clang < 14? fails. compiler thinks it has to prove constness, it works like static_assert(!!__builtin_constant_p(expr)) NOT static_assert(__builtin_constant_p(!!expr))
